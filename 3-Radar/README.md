# Radar

This project uses radar to generate a perception for a self-driving car, example of covered topics:
-   Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW);
-   Signal propagation;
-   Target cinematic; 
-   Response generation;
-   FFT 1D;
-   FFT 2D;
-   Range & Doppler generation;
-   2D CFAR (Constant False Alarm Rate);

### I. Preparation on Linux

Radar exercises and projects will be completed using MATLAB. It is required to register a MathWorks account [here](https://www.mathworks.com/mwaccount/register). Verify the email and log on the account, then download the installer for Ubuntu [here](https://www.mathworks.com/licensecenter/classroom/udacity_sf_radar/). If the license expiration date is ending soon, we can contact Udacity for an extension [support@udacity.com](support@udacity.com).

Unzip the `matlab_R2023b_glnxa64.zip` and run the installation script with sudo.
```bash
$ sudo ./install
$ ./matlab
```

Tutorial for MATLAB is available [here](https://www.mathworks.com/learn/tutorials/matlab-onramp.html).

### II. Knowledge build up with pratical exercises
